#Ex 3 Numbers and Math drill
#1.

#This line of code prints "I will now count my chickens:"
print("I will now count my chickens:")

#This lie of code prints the amount of hens taking the sum of numbers 25 and 30 and dividing by 6
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)

#This line of code prints the message "Now I will count the eggs:"
print("Now I will count the eggs:")

#This line of code prints the sum of 3,2 and 1 and minus's 5 from it also adds 4 then takes modulus 2 and minus one then divides by 4 and sums with 6
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

#This line of code asks if 3 sum 2 is less than 5 minus 7
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

#This line of code prints out the verdict of the question above about the the sum of 3 and 2 being less than 5-7
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

#This line of code asks what the sum of 3 and 2 is and gives the result beside it (the question)
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)

#This line of code asks for the result 5-7 and gives the result after the comma.
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

#This line of code prints an answer to why 3+2 is not less than 5-7. 
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

#The code below prints the message How about some more.
print("How about some more.")

#This line of code asks if 5 is greater than negative 2 and the code after the comma gives the result true or false
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)

#This line of code asks if 5 is greater than or equal to negative 2 and the code after the comma gives the result true or false
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)

#This line of code asks if 5 is less than or equal to negative 2 the code after the comma gives the result which is true or false.
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)

#3.
print("The Average age for the Manchester united starting XI for 2023/24 matchday one is:", (27 + 30 + 24 + 28 + 24 + 30 + 28 + 24 + 23 + 25 + 19) / 11 )

#4. My code was already appearing in floating point numbers.
