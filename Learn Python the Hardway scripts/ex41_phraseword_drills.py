#Class x(y): This means created class x that is a y
#Class x(Object):def __init__(self, j):class x has a function init which has two parameters self and J
#Class x(Object): def m(self, j): class x has a function m that has two paramters self and j
#foo = x(): Use foo as an instance of the class X
#foo.m(j) :From foo get M function whilst passing paramters j
#foo.k = Q: from foo get K and assign it to Q.

class x(object):
    def __init__(self,j):

class x(object):
    def m (self, j):
