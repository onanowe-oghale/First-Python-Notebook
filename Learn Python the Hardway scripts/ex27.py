"""
NOT: This negates whatever inputs it gets as not can only be one input so if it has on input of 1 (on) it gives an output of 0 (off)

OR: This gives an output of true if at least one output is 1 or true and the other possiblities would be false or 0 unlike the previous NOT gate the OR accepts two or more inputs

AND: This gives an output of true as far as both inputs are true or one leaving the rest as false.

NAND: NOT AND the NOT simply negates the AND and makes it the reverse of everything here every output is true except for when all are true

NOR: This negates the OR just like NAND seen previously the NOT makes all outputs false except from from when all inputs are false
