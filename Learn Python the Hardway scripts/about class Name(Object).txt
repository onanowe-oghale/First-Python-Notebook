In python 3 you do not need to add (object) after the name of the class,
but the python community believes in something that is very clear and without vagueness or ambiguity
is better than something that is understood, but not described clearly or directly, and often using implication or assumption.
class codes that do not have the (Object) would still run perfectly. It is at this point simply just extra documentation and has no impact on how our classes work.


class name (object) - This means that class name is a class of type object
just think of class name(object) as saying this is a basic simple class.
